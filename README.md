Anita's Kitchen Landing Page
This is my first project, which was to design a landing page for a restaurant called Anita's Kitchen. The landing page showcases the restaurant's menu, location, and contact information.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a simple and attractive landing page that would encourage visitors to learn more about the restaurant and visit in person. The page features a full-screen image of the restaurant's interior, as well as a section that highlights the restaurant's most popular dishes.

Technologies Used
This landing page was designed using HTML and CSS. I used HTML to structure the page and add content and CSS to style the page and make it responsive.

Getting Started
To view the landing page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. All of the necessary files are included in the repository.

Thank you for checking out my first project!
